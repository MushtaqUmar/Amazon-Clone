Have a Quick look: https://mushtaqumar.github.io/Amazon-Clone/

This repository offers a basic Amazon homepage clone built with HTML & CSS. HTML structures the content (navigation, hero section,footer etc.), while CSS styles the layout to mimic Amazon's design. It's a great starting point to learn web development fundamentals. Explore the code, or consider adding interactivity with JavaScript later! While static now, you could extend it with a backend for a more realistic e-commerce experience.
